# Earthquake Visualizer ðŸŒŽ

An interactive web application that helps visualize recent earthquake activity around the world. This tool is designed for geography students and enthusiasts like **Casey** who want to study seismic patterns and recent geological events. Built with React, Leaflet, and the USGS Earthquake API, the Earthquake Visualizer displays earthquake locations on an interactive map, complete with details such as magnitude, location, and time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Earthquake Data**: Displays recent earthquakes around the world using data from the USGS Earthquake API.
- **Interactive Map**: Uses Leaflet to render an interactive map that supports zooming and panning.
- **Customizable Markers**: Each earthquake is marked with a red circular marker, showing exact location and clickable details.
- **Detailed Popups**: Clicking on a marker reveals a popup with the earthquakeâ€™s magnitude, location, and timestamp.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles network errors and displays appropriate messages if data cannot be fetched.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- **Mapping Library**: [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) (integrated with Leaflet for interactive maps)
- **API**: [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/) for real-time earthquake data
- **CSS**: Custom CSS for clean, modern styling
